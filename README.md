# automatic-potato
Example of a new repo, constructed for the course Modern Data Analytics.
In this repository, we have included a notebook that contains a function which checks if a number is prime or not.
We also have a text file whose content is not really important but was used for showcasing Git.

As the name of this repo (which was automatically generated) is automatic-potato, we include a picture of a potato as well.
